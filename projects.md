### LÃ­f

The goal of this project is to design and implement an algorithm that takes a function as input and returns a version of it that is invariant. In other words, the resulting function must execute the same set of instructions regardless of its inputs. This technique can be applied to functions with sensitive data in a way that the resulting code is side-channel free.
