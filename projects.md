### Líf

The goal of this project is to design and implement an algorithm
that takes a function as input and returns a version of it that
is isochronous. In other words, the resulting function must
execute the same set of instructions and access the same set of
memory addresses, in the same order, regardless of its inputs.
This technique can be applied to functions with sensitive data to
eliminate timing-based side channels.
