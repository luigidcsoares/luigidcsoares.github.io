I'm a MSc student in [Computer Science](https://ppgcc.dcc.ufmg.br) @ [UFMG](https://ufmg.br). Currently, I'm working in the [Compilers Lab](http://lac.dcc.ufmg.br/) under the supervision of [Fernando Pereira](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/). My interests are primarily related to Programming Languages and Compilers. Functional languages are awesome, Haskell is beautiful and you should give it a try!
